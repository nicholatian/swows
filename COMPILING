BUILDING SWOWS

*****

PREINSTALL
----------

LINUX.

GCC et al, and dkp-pacman (unless on Arch, where regular pacman works).

MACOS.

‘brew install coreutils’ for GNU echo, needed for ANSI colour printing.

‘xcode-select --install’ for the compiler toolchain, used for building the
tools. install devkitARM and target tools with `dkp-pacman -S devkitARM grit gbalzss gbafix`; devkitPro pacman can be downloaded & installed from
<https://devkitpro.org/>.

WINDOWS.

Not supported, although if someone is interested, I am open to the use of WSL2.
I won’t be adding that myself anytime soon.

BUILD PROCESS
-------------

$ make

should output ‘swows.gba’ in the repository root. ‘make -j’ is supported.
